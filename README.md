### Welcome to the pok√©DEX

What is this?

It's a passion / toy project for me to get familiar with solana programming through pokemon
I coded it up on Rust through a bootcamp

#### TODO:

[ ] - Replace the swapper bg with a gradient-radial as well as the hover: colors for the selector to spice it up
[ ] - connect phantom and allow for transactions
[ ] - Read [this](https://spl.solana.com/token-swap) and just refactor this to use the Token Swap Program
