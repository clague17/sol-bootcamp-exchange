### Welcome to the pokÃ©DEX

What is this?

It's a passion / toy project for me to get familiar with solana programming through pokemon

I coded it up on Rust through a bootcamp

#### TODO:

- [ ] Replace the swapper bg with a gradient-radial as well as the hover: colors for the selector to spice it up
- [ ] connect phantom and allow for transactions
- [ ] Read [this](https://spl.solana.com/token-swap) and just refactor this to use the Token Swap Program
- [ ] Add animation for the linear ease when clicking the swap token direction button. I like how Orca does it visually.
- [ ] Handle the case where a user connects a wallet that has no ATAs for the two tokens -> potentially add an alert to redirect to another place where we can create one for them
